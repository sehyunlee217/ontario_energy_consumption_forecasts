Additionally, reliable and frequently updated expert temperature forecasts allow for adjustments in energy consumption predictions based on significant changes in future temperatures.\nHaving accurate forecasts for energy consumption is crucial, as they can inform planning for maintenance and repairs of electricity-generating facilities. Moreover, if we have access to monthly supply data, information on energy storage, and costs associated with energy generation at specific times in Ontario, this scenario could be framed as an optimization problem. Utilizing dynamic programming, we could optimize production and reduce costs for energy generation in the province."

Additionally, the strong negative spike at lag 12 indicates the presence of an MA(1) term in the seasonal component.\nIn the PACF plot, there is a clear indication at lag 1, pointing to an AR(1) term for the non-seasonal component. Similarly, the strong negative spike at lag 12 suggests an AR(1) term for the seasonal component.\nWe can compare our selected model to the AutoARIMA model generated by the fable package, which aims to minimize the AICc in a greedy manner. Upon comparison, we find that our custom model closely aligns with the optimal model produced by fable. It’s important to note that our model is an ARIMA(1,0,4)(1,1,1), as we previously applied seasonal differencing. When comparing the two ARIMA models, minimizing AICc and BIC is asympotically equivalent to Leave-one-out-Cross-Validation (M.Stone, 1977), making AICc a valuable metric for model selection.\n\n\n# A mable: 1 x 2\n                           autoARIMA                        ARIMA104111\n                             &lt;model&gt;                            &lt;model&gt;\n1 &lt;ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,2)[12] w/ drift&gt; &lt;ARIMA(1,0,4)(1,1,1)[12] w/ drift&gt;\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  .model        AIC  AICc   BIC\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 autoARIMA    533.  533.  560.\n2 ARIMA104111  534.  535.  569.\n\n\nPreceding with our custom model, our ARIMA(1,0,4)(1,1,1) model can be written as follows with the Backshift notation:\n\\[\n(1 - \\phi_{1}B)(1 - \\phi_{1}B^{12})(1- B^{12}) y_{t} = (1 + \\theta_{1}B + \\theta_{2}B^2 + \\theta_{3}B^3 + \\theta_{4}B^4)(1 + \\theta_{1}B^{12})\\epsilon_{t}\n\\] Lastly, we can visualize the residuals and its distributions to check that they are normally distributed, alongside the Ljung-Box test. The Null hypothesis for the Ljung-Box test is that the residuals do not display autocorrelation with each other. Furthremore, the degrees of freedom for this test is equivalent to the number of variables used in the model (7). Therfore, if we want to fail to reject the Null hypothesis in order to confirm that our model captured the correlated data from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .model      lb_stat lb_pvalue\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ARIMA104111    17.9     0.395\n\n\nOur p-value is 0.395 for the Ljung-Box test with a degree of freedom of 7; therefore, we conclude that the residuals are not autocorrelated, indicating that this model is a good fit at the 95% confidence level.\nTherefore, using this model, we can generate future forecasts for Ontario’s temperatures as follows."
